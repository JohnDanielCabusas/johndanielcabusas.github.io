    <div class="component-title">GRASS</div>
    <div class="component-description" id="grass-content">
      Grasses are the primary vegetation in the savanna ecosystem, with a mix of tall and short varieties. Savannas typically serve as a transition between forests and grasslands. While they contain trees like forests, unlike forests, the ground in savannas is mainly covered by grasses.
      <br><br>
      <strong>ROLE OF THE COMPONENT:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Producers: Grasses in the savanna ecosystem provide an ideal habitat for grazing animals like cows and zebras, helping to control grass growth.</li>
        <li>Habitat and Shelter: Grasses in the savanna ecosystem offer shelter for insects, small mammals, and reptiles, while also providing protection against predators.</li>
        <li>Soil Stabilization: It helps prevent soil erosion by anchoring the soil with the roots of the plants.</li>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="component animate__animated animate__fadeIn" onclick="toggleContent('temperature')">
    <div class="component-title">TEMPERATURE</div>
    <div class="component-description" id="temperature-content">
      The climate of the savanna is a significant factor. Temperatures typically range from 68° to 86°F (20 to 30°C), with a warm climate. Savannas are found in regions with a 4–6 month dry winter season and a 6–8 month wet summer season. 
      <br><br>
      <strong>ROLE OF THE COMPONENT:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Climate Regulation: Savannas are characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. Temperature variations influence the timing and intensity of these seasons. High temperatures during the dry season contribute to evaporation and moisture loss from soils and vegetation, leading to arid conditions.</li>
        <li>Water Availability: Temperature affects the rate of evaporation from soil and vegetation surfaces. High temperatures increase evaporation rates, contributing to water loss from the ecosystem. Conversely, lower temperatures can reduce evaporation, helping to conserve moisture in the soil and supporting plant survival during dry periods.</li>
        <li>Animal Behavior: Temperature influences the behavior and activity patterns of savanna animals. Many species are adapted to cope with hot temperatures, employing strategies such as seeking shade, reducing activity during the hottest parts of the day, or migrating to areas with more favorable conditions.</li>

    <div class="component animate__animated animate__fadeIn" onclick="toggleContent('scattered')">
        <div class="component-title">SCATTERED TREES</div>
        <div class="component-description" id="scattered-content">
            Trees in the savanna ecosystem are scattered across the landscape, with species like Acacia and Baobab. They provide food and shelter for animals, withstand drought, and often have thorns for protection.
            <br><br>
          <strong>ROLE OF THE COMPONENT:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide Food and Shelter:  Acacia trees offer food and shelter for a wide range of animals, including insects, birds, and mammals. Their leaves, pods, and flowers serve as important food sources for herbivores.</li>
            <li>Nurse Trees: Acacia trees often act as nurse trees, providing shade and protection for young plants to establish themselves in the harsh savanna environment.</li>
            <li>Soil Erosion Prevention: The extensive root systems of acacia trees help stabilize the soil, reducing erosion in the savanna ecosystem.</li>
